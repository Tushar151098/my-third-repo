    <h1>Checkout the Branch Bption</h1>
    <p>I am testing and learning how to make a branch. Making a branch and then marging them into the main one is the best way to wark in a group. To make a new branch, switch to that, marging that to the main one and then push it to the git hub will do the work.</p>
    <p>I just added a new branch named "pakhi".Now adding a image of a bird in here... And then marging this to the main branch.</p>
    <img src="bird.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The branch is successfully working. If I make any change in the code, I have to push it. And it will go to the branch.</p>
